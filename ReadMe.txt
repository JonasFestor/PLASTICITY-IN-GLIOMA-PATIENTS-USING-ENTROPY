This documentation pertains to the BSc thesis "Investigating Neuroplasticity in Glioma Patients using Sample Entropy from Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data."

In this repository, you can find the R script used and the results for each (entropy) parameter combination. 
The R script is annotated in a way that, with some code adjustments, the analysis can easily be run for different parameters. 
However, this annotation is not very useful anymore because the data has not been made available.

See thesis:
"Data Availability and Reproducibility Statement: The data set has not been made available, firstly, because data from bachelor theses are not available if journal publications have not taken place, and, secondly, due to internal hospital policies and ethical considerations." (Festor, 2024)

Nevertheless, the code might be helpful if similar analyses are conducted or for quality control.
